# Analysis of Marketing Campaign Effectiveness – May 2025

## Project Overview

This repository documents **Phase 1** of a marketing data analysis project focused on evaluating the performance of campaigns that concluded in **May 2025**. The objective of this phase is to ensure that the dataset is clean, reliable, and ready for analysis by addressing common data quality issues.

## Phase 1 Objectives: Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Conduct data cleaning and error handling using Python (Pandas)  
- Resolve issues related to missing values, duplicate identifiers, and inconsistent date formats  
- Standardize date fields and filter campaigns that ended in May 2025  
- Generate basic summary charts for quick insights  
- Document key observations to support deeper analysis in subsequent phases  

## Next Steps (Planned Phases)

This is the initial stage of a comprehensive marketing campaign analysis project. The following phases are planned:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** uncover trends and patterns  
- **Conversion funnel analysis:** identify drop-off points and optimize user flow  
- **KPI reporting and dashboards:** ROAS, CPL, regional performance
